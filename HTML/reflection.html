            <p>
                The purpose of my creative product is to spread more awareness about ovarian cancer. My 
                mother was diagnosed with it when it was in the very late stages meaning it wasnâ€™t going 
                to be curable. This was tough on me and my family and if she had been tested earlier or if 
                it had been caught, she may have been here today. I also wanted to look more into what my 
                mother had; I saw the result of chemo and surgery, but I had never delved deep into the 
                cancer itself. When writing this I wanted to be very informative in the case that one day 
                someone may come across it if they are going through the same thing I did or if they 
                themselves have been diagnosed. I feel that by spreading awareness of this type of cancer, 
                more people can be saved and potentially more people will get tested. I formatted the 
                creative product in a webpage because it fits with me being a computer science major and 
                I am also currently in intro web design, so this gave me a great way to display and hone my 
                skills! My process of creating this piece was first to write it all up in a Word document so 
                that I could have the fall back of catching spelling mistakes and grammar errors. It also 
                provided a great way for me to organize how I wanted my website to be laid out before writing 
                any code, which is way better than organizing it on the fly. After having all the 
                organizational pieces done, I then crafted the structure of my website in my code editor. 
                Once the structure was done and had all the main paragraphs typed out, I copied and pasted 
                my written-out things from Word to my code document. Then I applied some CSS styling to make 
                it look nice and I was finished!
