            <h2>Overview</h2>

            <br>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Cancer is a widely talked about disease. Is there a cure for it? What is it? 
                These are the many types of questions that surround the disease. 
                There are many different types of cancers which makes it difficult to develop one cure 
                for all cancers. Simply put, cancer is uncontrolled cell growth. The main way that cancer 
                arises is through problems in the cell cycle that allow a cell to keep growing and dividing, 
                eventually becoming a tumor. In this article I am going to address the cell cycle, its checks,
                and then a brief overview of cancer, then get into ovarian cancer: what it is, how its caused, 
                and finally treatments for it.
            </p>

            <h3>The Cell Cycle</h3>
            <figure class = image>
                <img src = "../Images/cellCycle.png" alt = "image of cancer">
            </figure>
            <p>
                The cell cycle is integral to all life on earth since we all have cells.  The result 
                of this process is an identical cell to the one being replicated in order to replace 
                a lost cell or to create another. Without this process we wouldnâ€™t be able to grow or 
                heal. There are two major parts of the cell cycle, interphase and mitosis. Interphase 
                can be split up into three distinct parts: G1 phase, synthesis phase (S phase), and 
                G2 phase. G1 or first gap is the phase where the cell gets ready to replicate DNA and 
                also gathers the materials nessecary to do this. A small off shoot of this phase is 
                G0 where most cells stay if they aren't dividing, a cell will only ever enter G1 when 
                it is getting ready to divide. The next part, synthesis, is where DNA replication occurs. 
                The result is two sister chromatids attached together by a centromere. Along with this 
                the duplication of a centrosome will give rise to a miotic spindle which is useful in 
                mitosis. G2 or second gap is where the cell regains energy, synthesizes proteins, and 
                duplicates some organelles. Finally, mitosis is where the cell divides, the sister 
                chromatids are aligned along the center of the cell, then they are pulled apart to opposite 
                ends of the cell where two nuclei form and then cytokinesis splits them apart into two cells.  
            </p>

            <h3>Cell Cycle Checkpoints</h3>
            <p>
                Along the way in the process of the cell cycle there are checkpoints to make sure everything 
                is correct. The first one is in G1 where the cell is checked so that all conditions are met 
                for cell division and that there is no harm to genetic material, if this is all met then 
                proceeds to G2. This is where the cell will fully commit to cell division, if conditions are 
                not met it will not be let past this point. The next checkpoint is in G2 where the check is 
                to make sure DNA was replicated correctly and there isn't damage to genetic material. This 
                check point prevents passage into mitosis. The final check point is within mitosis where it 
                checks that all sister chromatids are attached to the miotic spindle. Although the check 
                points and the cell cycle is a good process, mistakes do happen. Sometimes they are minor 
                and result in apoptosis (programmed cell death) or sometimes they slip past a check point 
                and become cancerous.  
            </p>

            <h3>Cancer</h3>
            <p>
                Cancer is the result of the cell cycle going haywire and put simply is uncontrolled cell 
                growth which results in a tumor. All types of cancer are triggered by a gene mutation, 
                either a mutation of the proto-oncogenes or the cancer suppressor genes. Proto-oncogenes 
                are stimulating regulators that stimulate growth and when mutated become oncogenes. 
                Oncogenes are genes that cause a cell to become cancerous.  So, when a protooncogene is 
                mutated into an oncogene it just puts pedal to the metal on growth, not checking if things 
                are correct and just continuously going through the cell cycle. The other type of gene, tumor 
                suppressor genes, act as inhibitory regulators. That means that they inhibit the cell cycle 
                from going off the rails.  When dealing with cancer there are many risk factors involved and 
                there are many options for treatment. For a specific example read further to find out what 
                ovarian cancer is, what can cause it, and how it can be treated.

            <h3>What is ovarian cancer?</h3>

            <figure class = image>
                <img src = "../Images/ovarian-cancer.jpg" alt = "image of cancer">
            </figure>

            <p>
                Ovarian cancer is cancer in the cells that form the ovaries. The gene mutation that causes 
                this cancer can happen in different parts of the ovaries which leads to different types of 
                ovarian cancer.  The most common one is epithelial ovarian cancer which has many different 
                subtypes, then there are stromal tumors, and finally germ cell tumors. The development of a 
                tumor in the ovaries can have big health complications if not treated properly or soon enough. If treated early the cancer can only develop into stage I but if left untreated it can progress to stage IV which can prove to be fatal.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h3>Causes</h3>
            <p>
                There is no direct thing that causes ovarian cancer, but there are certain actions that can 
                increase your risk. Risk factors may include age, obesity, inherited gene mutations, family 
                history, having children later in life, and the list goes on.  Some of these are what are 
                called inherited genetic mutations (family history and inherited gene mutations) which are 
                mutations that happen to women with ovarian cancer that may be passed down to children. The 
                genes linked to this are the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, but there are many others that are 
                related to family cancers that can develop into ovarian cancer. Other risk factors are 
                acquired genetic changes which are a result of radiation or cancer-causing chemicals 
                throughout one's life, although this is uncommon to cause ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer 
                has not been able to be linked to a specific one of these chemicals.  
            </p>

            <br>

            <h3>Treatments</h3>
            <p>
                There are many ways to treat ovarian cancer, by far the most common is chemotherapy. 
                Chemotherapy (or chemo) is a treatment that involves the usage of powerful drugs that kill 
                fast growing cells. This targets cancer but also targets your hair cells as well other 
                healthy cells in the body that may be rapidly dividing. This can have many other side effects 
                because the chemicals involved aren't exactly good for you. These side effects include 
                fatigue, immune compilation, vomiting, and many others. Another option to treat ovarian 
                cancer is hormone therapy which uses hormones or hormone blockers. There are many different 
                typed of drugs that do this with varying side effects such as weakened bones and blood clots.
                This form or treatment is mainly used to treat epithelial ovarian cancer and ovarian stromal 
                tumors. There are many options out there for treatment with varying side effects and results, 
                it is all based on the individual, what is right for them, and what stage of cancer they are at.  
            </p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                In conclusion there are many different forms of ovarian cancer and no one thing can cause it 
                just as no one treatment can cure it. Cancer is a very tangled and difficult issue not just 
                medically but societally as well. There are lots of moving parts when dealing with any cancer 
                which can all be traced back to a gene mutation and the cell cycle.
